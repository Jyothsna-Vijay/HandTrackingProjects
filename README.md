# Hand Tracking Projects

# Description

This repository contains **four** interactive **hand-tracking projects** built using **Python, OpenCV,** and **Google Mediapipe**. 
Each project demonstrates real-time computer vision techniques, including hand landmark detection, gesture recognition, and interactive control using hand movements. 
These projects highlight practical experience with data structures, algorithms, and human-computer interaction.

# Projects Included

**AI Virtual Mouse**

- AI-powered virtual mouse in Python using OpenCV, implementing contour detection and gesture recognition algorithms to replace hardware input with hand tracking.

  - Control the mouse pointer using hand gestures.

  - Detects finger positions to move the cursor and perform click actions.

  - Demonstrates mapping of hand landmark coordinates to screen coordinates.

**AI Virtual Painter**

- Gesture-based virtual painting application, applying hand-tracking algorithms and coordinate mapping to enable intuitive real-time drawing without hardware peripherals.

  - Draw on the screen using finger movements.

  - Supports multiple colours and a rubber tool.

  - Implements smoothing of hand trajectories for natural drawing.

**Volume Control**

- Computer-vision-based volume controller using distance algorithms on hand landmarks, enabling natural, touch-free interaction with system audio.

  - Control system volume using the distance between the thumb and index finger.

  - Implements linear interpolation and smoothing for smooth control.

  - Visual sound bar for easy recognition.

**Finger Counter**

- Real-time finger counting system with computer vision, leveraging hand landmarks for number recognition.

  - Counts the number of fingers held up in real time.

  - Useful for gesture recognition and interactive applications.

  - Demonstrates logic for analysing Mediapipe hand landmarks.

# Features / Highlights

- Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe.

- Gesture recognition for interactive applications.
